# Open Source Hiring (tentative name)
A job site that lists job postings that are open at open source companies!

## Motivation
Open source is the future. It's a great way for candidates to practice their craft, showcase their skills, and network with other engineers.

For companies, it's a great way to discover talent they might miss otherwise.

So, what if there was a website that lists job postings that are open at these open source-centric companies?

What would the application process look like then?

Instead of using a traditional resume, perhaps there will be a way for you to showcase your open source contributions.

Instead of a traditional hiring process, perhaps you will get a chance to do some part-time contract work in open source as a trial period.

We're not sure what it'd look like exactly, but I personally think there are a lot of interesting possibilities here.

## How we're going to build it
We're going to build it, the open source way, of course! This repo is under MIT license, and we're going to build it here.

## Tech stack
We don't know yet what the tech stack is going to be.

One idea I have for it is, Django + Postgres + TailwindCSS.

Since it'll mostly be a static site, using something like Django is probably reasonable.

For hosting - probably something like Fly.io or Railway.app.

## Job postings:

Have you come across any job posting at an open source company? Feel free to add it below with the format:

\<Position Name\> at \<Company\>, expiring at December 1, 2022

Just to keep all the job posts fresh, let's have them expire in 3 months by default.
