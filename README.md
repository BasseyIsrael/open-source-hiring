# Open Source Hiring (tentative name)
A job site that lists job postings that are open at open source companies!

## Motivation
Open source is the future. It's a great way for candidates to practice their craft, showcase their skills, and network with other engineers.

For companies, it's a great way to discover talent they might miss otherwise.

## How we're going to build it
We're going to biuld it, the open source way, of course! This repo is under MIT license, and we're going to build it here.

## Tech stack
We don't know yet what the tech stack is going to be.

One idea I have for it is, Django + Postgres + TailwindCSS.

Since it'll mostly be a static site, using something like Django is probably reasonable.

For hosting - probably something like Fly.io or Railway.app.
